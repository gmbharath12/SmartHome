# SmartHome
To control home appliances.
The concept of Smarthome has numerous advantages and this industry is in its nascent stage. Several companies have successfully developed IoT devices to create a ‘SmartHome’, where devices can be controlled from a smartphone or laptop from anywhere. Applications include temperature control, lighting, door locks, etc. While these offer good customer experience individually, it is hard to integrate these and other IoT devices into a single system since IoT device vendors provide their own customized control systems for their devices. 

I'm building an iOS app to control these home devices.
